= Contributing

*Want to contribute? Great!*
We try to make it easy, and all contributions, even the smaller ones, are greatly welcome.
This includes bug reports, fixes, documentation.

All SmallRye projects use GitHub Issues to manage issues.
Open an issue directly in GitHub within the appropriate SmallRye project repository.

== Becoming a Project Committer

Through continued contributions to SmallRye projects,
other committers on the project can nominate you to become a committer too!

== Legal

All original contributions to SmallRye projects are licensed under the
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[ASL - Apache License],
version 2.0 or later, or,
if another license is specified as governing the file or directory being modified, such other license.

All contributions are subject to the https://developercertificate.org/[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)].
The DCO text is also included verbatim in the _dco.txt_ file in the root directory of each repository.

== Before you Contribute

To contribute, use GitHub Pull Requests, from your *own* fork.

=== Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, need to be reviewed before they are merged.

=== Continuous Integration

We're all human, so SmallRye projects use continuous integration to ensure consistency,
particularly as most SmallRye projects need to pass the applicable MicroProfile TCK for that specification.
Each pull request triggers a full build of the project.
Please make sure to monitor the output of the build and act accordingly.

=== Tests and Documentation are not optional

Don't forget to include tests in your pull requests.
Also, don't forget the documentation (Javadoc).

== Setup

If you have not done so on your machine, you need to:

- Install Git and configure your GitHub access
- Install Java SDK (OpenJDK recommended)
- Install Maven

=== IDE Config and Code Style

SmallRye projects have a strictly enforced code style.
Code formatting is done by the Eclipse code formatter,
using the config files found in https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-code-rules/tree/master/src/main/resources/io/smallrye/coderules[Code Rules].
By default when you run `mvn install` the code will be formatted automatically.
When submitting a pull request the CI build will fail if running the formatter results in any code changes,
so it is recommended that you always run a full Maven build before submitting a pull request.

==== Eclipse Setup

Open the *Preferences* window, and then navigate to _Java_ -> _Code Style_ -> _Formatter_.
Click _Import_ and then select the `eclipse-format.xml` file in the `coderules` directory.

Next navigate to _Java_ -> _Code Style_ -> _Organize Imports_.
Click _Import_ and select the `eclipse.importorder` file.

==== IDEA Setup

Open the _Preferences_ window, navigate to _Plugins_ and install the [Eclipse Code Formatter Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546-eclipse-code-formatter).

Restart your IDE, open the *Preferences* window again and navigate to _Other Settings_ -> _Eclipse Code Formatter_.

Select _Use the Eclipse Code Formatter_,
then change the _Eclipse Java Formatter Config File_ to point to the `eclipse-format.xml` file in the `coderules` directory.
Make sure the _Optimize Imports_ box is ticked, and select the `eclipse.importorder` file as the import order config file.

=== Signing Commits

Signing commits is required to make sure that the contributor matches the author. To be able to sign commits, use the following instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits

== The small print
